    <h1 class="head">SOLO LEVELING</h1>
    <p class="para1">
Solo Leveling is one of the most popular modern fantasy-action stories — originally a South Korean web novel that evolved into a webtoon (manhwa), 
anime adaptation, and even games. 
It’s often credited with popularizing the “level-up” and “system” subgenres of modern fantasy in both Korean and Japanese media.
